                Last Monday I boarded a small propeller plane out of Nassau, The Bahamas to a forest covered out island. Cat Island is the one place in the world where you can dive with this particular pelagic shark, as they spend most of their time in deeps waters off of the continental shelf. Two dive operations are available to spend time with this amazing animals, and I was there with Stewart’s Cove, purveyor of shark dives across the islands of The Bahamas. They run this trip for a short time around May each year, and I decided when I learned of it in SCUBA Diving Magazine last October or November, that I would be doing it this year.

                <h3>The Sea Dog Name</h3>
                Mariners for years referred to sharks as sea dogs, as they would follow behind ships, and whitetips were the most common ship following shark. The animals are menacing to many. People viewing my images from the trip have had varied responses, but many clearly saw this as a very dangerous dive. That said, the sharks were docile, and curious. They would swim right up to you, and as long as you didn’t make a move towards them, they would only turn away at the last moment. They got so close that I was able to get these images with a fisheye lens. The sharks were well within arms length on several occasions, often sneaking up on you if you fiddled with your camera. That said, when divers would make a move to touch them, they would quickly move away, apprehensive about their intentions.

                <h3>In Decline</h3>
                The whitetip’s large fin is highly demanded for use in shark fin soup, and as a result their population is in steep decline. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, their population is estimated to have dropped by around 70% between 1990 and 2000 in the Northwest, and Western Central Atlantic, and is estimated to have virtually disappeared from the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of this, countries that fish the whitetip are now required to take measures to reduce fishing of this shark, and it has received full protection in New Zealand, one of the areas where it’s fished. Hopefully these measures will be successful, and this amazing animal will be following ships around the ocean for the next 500 years.
